# Stopwatch Project

## About the Project

This is a simple and interactive Stopwatch application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The stopwatch allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times in a clean and user-friendly interface. It's designed with a focus on simplicity and minimalism, ensuring ease of use for anyone needing a quick timer for various tasks.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Timer**: Click the start button to begin timing and pause whenever needed.
- **Reset**: Easily reset the timer back to zero.
- **Lap Functionality**: Record multiple lap times while the stopwatch is running.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices of different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Personal Motivation

This project was a great opportunity to reinforce my knowledge of core web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, without relying on any external libraries or frameworks. As someone passionate about **frontend development**, I wanted to challenge myself by building a functional app using only the essential web development tools. This project also allowed me to practice event handling in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and responsive design principles, key skills in my journey as a budding full-stack developer.
